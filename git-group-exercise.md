# W3 - Fun with git

We will play storytelling game (description [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_game)) using Git

1. Divide into groups of max 5 people
2. One person in each group
    - Create repository on GitHub
    - Add file, e.g. `story.txt` with the beginning of the story
    ```
    Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
    But today strange thing happened. John woke up and went to bathroom, where he saw...
    ```
    - Push your file on github
    
 3. Each person in the group 
    - Fork repository
    - Create branch
    - Switch to that branch
    - Open `story.txt` and write 5 sentences
    - Push your changes to github
    - Create pull request
    
4. The whole group
    - Review pull request
    - Merge conflicts

Repeat steps 3-4 untill the story is complete or you run out of time, whichever comes first
